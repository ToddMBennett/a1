      <hr>
      <p> Hi! My name is Todd Michael Bennett and I am based out of Denver but frequently fly to Asia for business.
          I started an educational consulting firm in Seoul, South Korea about five years ago and deal with companies
          like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG.  I recruit top corporate trainers that hold seminars and workshops, educating
          employees to get-up-to-speed on various topics related to business.</p>
      <p>I joined this class to further my understanding with coding and become more familiar with server-side code.
         For the past couple of years, I have been learning client-side programming i.e., HTML, CSS, and JS.  I realize
         that these technologies are great but want to understand the whole picture and how the back-end works.  So, here
         I am and excited to learn everything about PHP and related technologies</p>
